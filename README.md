# Overview

This is a simple drawing app where you can create and erase any drawing. There's also a feature to mirror the "pencil" so you can create symmetrical shapes and one to clear the board. The purpose of this software is to test my skills and new found knowledge in Typescript. For that reason, I also added some extra functions that you can find in the console of the browser to test how to make async functions, recursion, and lists using typescript.

## YouTube demonstration.

<!-- 4-5 min demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax. -->

## Development Environment

### Tools used and Programming Languages 
I used node for the server, typescript for the programming language, and the Canvas API

## Useful Websites

- [MDN Web Docs - Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)

## Future Work

Some things I want to fix, improve, or add in the future:

- I want to make so I can change the color of the "pencil"
- I want to fix the mirror feature so instead of filled shapes, the outline is the only thing drawn
- I want to improve the design with a proper 'tools' bar with all the options of what you can do
